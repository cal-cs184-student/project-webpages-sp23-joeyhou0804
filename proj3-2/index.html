        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).

        <p>This project builds on the previous project, acquiring it with more functionalities to render various surfaces in different environments.</p>
        <p>For the first two parts, the project focuses on rendering several types of materials.</p>
        <p>The thrid part focuses on dealing with environment light, which adds more types of light to the existing set of lights.</p>
        <p>The fourth part simulates the view behind a thin lens, which brings the effect of depth of field.</p>
        <p>For this project, I finished all four parts, and I would like the 1st and the 4th one to be graded.</p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>

        <p>For the material of mirror, it has the ability ro reflect light.
            When a ray of light reflects, it changes its direction at the intersection point of the original ray and the material surface.
            Since there is only one way of reflecting a ray of light, the pdf was set to 1 when deciding the direction of the direction of the new ray.
        </p>
        <p>For materials like glass, there is not only reflection happening when a ray of light reaches the surface.
            Sometimes, there could be refraction, which is also how the direction of the ray changes suddenly at the intersection point because of the difference of refractive index.
        </p>
        <p>When the angle is too big, there is total internal reflection happening, meaning that there is only reflection.</p>
        <p>All the other details can be calculated by following the given instructions.</p>

            We can notice that the reflection takes place only when the light ray depth is greater than 1.
            This is true as reflection of the scene (like walls) requires the light has a depth of at least 2.
            When the ray depth is 1, only the light source is reflected into the camera.
            When the depth increases, both reflection and refraction can take place, making the image brighter because of a more complete lighting environment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            For the first image, there is only the light source itself being lit.
            When the max ray depth is 1, all other materials other than mirror and glass can be lit in this scene.
            When the max ray depth is 2, the reflection light can go into the camera, and thus making the the mirror ball lit.
            The image being reflected is, however, one step behind the real rendered surface.
            For example, although the top is already being lit by second bounces from walls, it still looks dark on the ball.
            When the max ray depth is 3, the refraction light can go into the camera, making the glass ball being lit, too.
            After that, with the max depth increasing, the image is rendered more and more bright, due to the dact that there are light with more bounces being received by the camera.
        </p>

            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.

        <p>For a pinhole camera, the origin of all rays that come out of the camera start from a single point.
            The ray also extends to both the image plane and the focus plane, making the directions being the same.
        </p>
        <p>For a thin lens, not everything is in focus, and the origin of rays can be everywhere on the lens.
            Only the ray that passes through the center of the lens doesn't change its direction.
            All the other rays will bend, however their intersection point on the focus plane will not change from the one that is produces by the ray passing though the center of the lens.
            Also, thin lenses bring focal distances, meaning that only objects within the plane at focal distance will be in focus.
